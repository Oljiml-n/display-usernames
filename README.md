# display-usernames

I created a webpage that validates a user and returns user details
* It works by:
    * Accepting details from the user using prompts
    * Using an object to store user details
    * Validating user details
    * Ensuring that username must be less than ten
    * Ensuring that password must be greater than six
    * Ensuring that the user must confirms password
    * If username and password do not match, it alerts the user
    * Displaying the user details
